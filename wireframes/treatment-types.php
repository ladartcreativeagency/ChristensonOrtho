              <p class="lead">Traditional metal braces are the most common for children, teens and adults. These braces are made from high-grade stainless steel and come with the option of adding colored elastics (rubber bands) for a fun, unique smile! Metal braces are smaller, more comfortable than ever before!</p>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p class="text-justify">We offer clear braces (ceramic braces) for teens and adults. Clear braces are made of clear materials and make the braces less visible than metal braces. They can be more fragile than metal braces and therefore are used for patients with cosmetic concerns who are willing manage the upkeep.</p>

      <h2>INVISALIGN</h2>

              <img src="img/invisalign.jpg" alt="Invisalign" class="aligncenter add-bottom">
          </div>
          <div class="large-7 medium-7 small-12 columns">
              <p class="lead">Consider Invisalign treatment to get the beautiful straight teeth you've always wanted — without braces. A complimentary consultation with our doctor can determine if Invisalign clear aligners are right for you.</p>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p class="text-justify">Invisalign treatment uses a series of virtually invisible, removable, and comfortable aligners that allow you to smile more during treatment as well as after. Invisalign clear aligners are made with 3D computer imaging technology and has been proven effective. More than 70% of orthodontists in the US and Canada are certified to administer Invisalign treatment.</p>
      <h3>Why You Want It:</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">Not only are the aligners virtually invisible, they are removable, so you can eat and drink what you want while in treatment. Plus, brushing and flossing are no problem. They are also more comfortable than traditional braces, with no metal or wires, which also usually means you spend less time in your doctor's office getting adjustments. Invisalign treatment also allows you to view your own virtual treatment plan when you start so you can see how your straight teeth will look when your treatment is complete.</p>

      <h3>How It Works:</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">You wear each set of aligners for about two weeks, removing them only to eat, drink, brush, and floss. As you replace each aligner with the next in the series, your teeth will move — little by little, week by week — until they have straightened to their final positions. You'll visit us about once every six weeks to ensure that your treatment is progressing as planned. Total treatment time averages nine to 15 months and the average number of aligners worn during treatment is between 18 and 30, but both will vary from case to case.</p>

      <h3>Primary Benefits of Invisalign:</h3>
      <p class="text-justify">Invisalign aligners are clear, making Invisalign a seamless fit with your lifestyle and day-to-day interactions with others. Invisalign aligners are also removable. Unlike braces, you have the flexibility to eat and drink what you want during treatment simply by removing the aligners when you eat. You can also remove the aligners to brush and floss as you normally would for fresh breath and good oral hygiene. Unlike traditional metal braces, Invisalign treatment does not use metal brackets or wires that could cause irritation to your mouth. In addition, you'll spend less time in the doctor's chair and scheduling appointments, and more time out doing the things you love. Lastly, Invisalign’s technology allows you to view your virtual results and treatment plan before you start your treatment, so that you can preview how your straight teeth will look once your treatment is complete.</p>
