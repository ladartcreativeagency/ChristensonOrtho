## Design Assets Needed:

 [ - ] Vector graphics of logos/badges for any membership associations

 [ - ] Consistent profile images of team

 [ - ] "Action" shots of patients being worked on by staff

 [ - ] Patient "checking out" at front desk

 [ - ] Outside pics of offices

 [ - ] Patient before and after photos

 [ - ] Any event photos that are new

 [ - ] Better profile photo of Dr. C

 [ - ] BONUS: If possible some video of patients being worked that could be used as ambient looping background video for homepage header

## Other Thoughts:

 [ - ] Create mailchimp account if they have an email list of patients for effecient communications
