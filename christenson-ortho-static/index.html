                <p class="lead">It's important for you to know how to properly take care of your braces throughout your entire orthodontic treatment.</p>

                <h3>Foods to avoid with braces:</h3>
                <ul class="hyphen-list">
                    <li>Chewy foods — bagels, licorice</li>
                    <li>Crunchy foods — popcorn, chips, ice</li>
                    <li>Sticky foods — caramel candies, chewing gum</li>
                    <li>Hard foods — nuts, hard candies</li>
                    <li>Foods that require biting into — corn on the cob, apples, carrots</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Soreness Caused from Braces and Appliances</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">When you first get your braces, you may notice that your teeth and mouth feel a little tender or sore. To relieve the pain, we recommend <mark>dissolving one teaspoon of salt in eight ounces of lukewarm water.</mark> Swish and gargle this solution in your mouth for just a couple of minutes (do not swallow the saltwater).</p>

                <p class="text-justify">If the pain is more severe and does not go away after rinsing, you can also <mark>try taking a pain reliever.</mark> It is also not uncommon for your lips, cheeks, and tongue to become irritated for one to two weeks as they toughen and become used to the braces. We would be <mark>happy to give you some wax that you can put over the braces to lessen the tenderness.</mark> If you need some wax, please let us know.</p>

                <h3>Loose Wires and Bands</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">The wires and bands on your braces may come loose. If this happens, please contact us as soon as possible so that we can check and repair your appliance. If any piece of your appliance comes off, be sure to save it and bring it to the office with you.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">If the loose wire is causing irritation to your lips or cheeks, put wax or a wet cotton ball over the broken wire to relieve the pain.</p>

                <h3>Take Care of Your Appliances</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Damaged appliances can increase the length of your treatment process, so be sure to take care of all your appliances. Your teeth and jaw can only move into their correct positions if you consistently wear the rubber bands, headgear, retainer, or other appliances prescribed by your doctor.</p>

                <h2 id="retainer-instructions">RETAINER INSTRUCTIONS</h2>

                <ul class="hyphen-list">
                    <li>Wear your retainer at all times, until the doctor instructs otherwise.</li>
                    <li>Take your retainer out when eating, and always put it back in its case! (Most appliances are lost in school lunchrooms or restaurants.)</li>
                    <li>Clean the retainer thoroughly once a day with a toothbrush and toothpaste. Use warm but not hot water. Brushing retainers removes the plaque, and eliminates odors. Efferdent&reg; (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Efferdent-Denture-Cleanser-Minty-Ingredients/dp/B000GGHS7G/ref=sr_1_cc_3_a_it?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1459149987&sr=1-3-catcorr&keywords=Efferdent" target="_blank"><small>you can buy it on Amazon.com <i class="fa fa-amazon"></i></small></a>) or other orthodontic appliance cleaners can be used but do not take the place of brushing.</li>
                    <li>When your retainer is not in your mouth, it should ALWAYS be in its case. Pets love to chew on them!</li>
                    <li>Initially, you may find it difficult to speak. Practice speaking, reading, or singing out loud to get used to it faster.</li>
                    <li>Retainers are breakable, so treat yours with care. If your retainer gets lost or broken, <a href="tel:757-482-7660">call us</a> immediately.</li>
                    <li>If you have any questions or concerns about your retainer, or you believe it needs adjusting, call us. Do not try to adjust it yourself.</li>
                    <li>Always bring your retainer to your appointments.</li>
                    <li>Retainer replacements are expensive, but with proper care they will last for years!</li>
                    <li>Remove your retainer when you go swimming.</li>
                    <li>Keep retainers away from hot water, hot car dashboards, pockets, the washing machine, and napkins.</li>

                <h2>FINANCIAL INFORMATION:</h2>

                <p class="lead">We don't want finances to stand in the way of a beautiful smile. The fee for orthodontic treatment depends on the complexity of the problem, appliances utilized, and length of treatment. Our treatment coordinator will explain fees and payment options with low down payment.</p>

                <h3>We offer the following financial options:</h3>

                <ul class="hyphen-list">
                    <li>Interest-free monthly payments option with low down payment</li>
                    <li>Discount for payment in full</li>
                    <li>Auto Drafts from checking accounts or credit cards</li>
                    <li>Most major credit cards accepted</li>
                    <li>Insurance billing</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">If you have dental insurance with orthodontic coverage we submit all documentation on your behalf. We will work with you and your insurance carrier to make sure you will obtain all of your benefits. Any unpaid insurance balance will be the patient's responsibility. Check with your carrier; most likely we are listed as one of their preferred providers.</p>


                    <hr class="section-break">

                <h2>YOUR FIRST VISIT</h2>

                <p class="lead">Our greatest goal is to give you the healthy, straight, beautiful smile that you've always wanted.

Our practice utilizes the latest technology, offering a variety of safe and gentle treatment options to give you the customized, individual care you deserve.</p>

                <h3>Every smile starts with an initial consultation!</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Your initial consultation will give you the opportunity to meet our team, learn more about orthodontics, receive a complete initial exam, and find out which treatment options will best meet your needs.</p>
                <h4>During your initial consultation, we will:</h4>
                <ul class="hyphen-list">
                    <li>Review your dental and medical history forms</li>
                    <li>Provide a complete oral exam, with X-rays, to determine whether treatment is necessary</li>
                    <li>Help you create a customized treatment plan</li>
                    <li>Discuss all financial information, insurance options, and payment plans</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="text-justify">Our team will be glad to answer any questions you may have, and we will provide all of the information that you need to determine which treatment is right for you. Please contact our practice to schedule your initial consultation.</p>

                <h3>After the Initial Consultation:</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">You're one step closer to achieving the smile you've always wanted! After your consultation, we will schedule your first appointment and your doctor will place your new orthodontic appliance. This appointment generally takes about an hour, and during this time our team will be available to make sure that you are as comfortable as possible.</p>

                <h3>Scheduling Appointments:</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">Visiting the orthodontist about every four to eight weeks is an important part of your orthodontic treatment. Our practice will work with you to make sure that your appointments are as convenient as possible. When scheduling appointments, please let us know what days and times work best for you.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">We understand that &quot;life happens&quot;! If you're running late or need to reschedule, please let us know and we will do everything we can to accommodate you. When you're ready to schedule your first appointment, contact our practice and our friendly scheduling coordinator will assist you. We're looking forward to working with you.</p>

                <h3>Visiting the dentist during orthodontic treatment:</h3>

                <p class="text-justify">It is very important that you continue to visit your family dentist once every six months, even during your orthodontic treatment, for teeth cleanings and routine dental checkups. If extra dental care is needed, we will be happy to coordinate with your family dentist to make sure that you are receiving the best care possible.</p>


                    <hr class="section-break">


                <h2>TRADITONAL BRACES</h2>

                <p class="text-justify">Traditional metal braces are the most common for children, teens and adults. These braces are made from high-grade stainless steel and come with the option of adding colored elastics (rubber bands) for a fun, unique smile! Metal braces are smaller, more comfortable than ever before!</p>

                <p class="text-justify">We offer clear braces (ceramic braces) for teens and adults. Clear braces are made of clear materials and make the braces less visible than metal braces. They can be more fragile than metal braces and therefore are used for patients with cosmetic concerns who are willing manage the upkeep.</p>


                    <hr class="section-break">



                <h2>INVISALIGN</h2>

                <p class="lead">Consider Invisalign treatment to get the beautiful straight teeth you've always wanted — without braces. A complimentary consultation with our doctor can determine if Invisalign clear aligners are right for you.</p>

                <p class="text-justify">Invisalign treatment uses a series of virtually invisible, removable, and comfortable aligners that allow you to smile more during treatment as well as after. Invisalign clear aligners are made with 3D computer imaging technology and has been proven effective. More than 70% of orthodontists in the US and Canada are certified to administer Invisalign treatment.</p>

                <h3>Why You Want It:</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">Not only are the aligners virtually invisible, they are removable, so you can eat and drink what you want while in treatment. Plus, brushing and flossing are no problem. They are also more comfortable than traditional braces, with no metal or wires, which also usually means you spend less time in your doctor's office getting adjustments. Invisalign treatment also allows you to view your own virtual treatment plan when you start so you can see how your straight teeth will look when your treatment is complete.</p>

                <h3>How It Works:</h3>
                <p class="text-justify">You wear each set of aligners for about two weeks, removing them only to eat, drink, brush, and floss. As you replace each aligner with the next in the series, your teeth will move — little by little, week by week — until they have straightened to their final positions. You'll visit us about once every six weeks to ensure that your treatment is progressing as planned. Total treatment time averages nine to 15 months and the average number of aligners worn during treatment is between 18 and 30, but both will vary from case to case.</p>

                Primary Benefits of Invisalign:
                <p class="text-justify">Invisalign aligners are clear, making Invisalign a seamless fit with your lifestyle and day-to-day interactions with others. Invisalign aligners are also removable. Unlike braces, you have the flexibility to eat and drink what you want during treatment simply by removing the aligners when you eat. You can also remove the aligners to brush and floss as you normally would for fresh breath and good oral hygiene. Unlike traditional metal braces, Invisalign treatment does not use metal brackets or wires that could cause irritation to your mouth. In addition, you'll spend less time in the doctor's chair and scheduling appointments, and more time out doing the things you love. Lastly, Invisalign’s technology allows you to view your virtual results and treatment plan before you start your treatment, so that you can preview how your straight teeth will look once your treatment is complete.</p>
